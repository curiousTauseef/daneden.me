At the Dropbox office in San Francisco, office room navigation is a bit of a
nightmare. Office rooms are named after company memes, in-jokes, or city
landmarks—things like *Makini Train, I Sync NY,* and *Doorman Drew*. Obviously,
this naming system is much less sterile than something like “Office Room 20A,”
but not without a cost. Rooms are ordered alphabetically by size, meaning that
all the 12-person rooms starting with the letter “T” are more or less in the
same place, but within that group, you’ll find a 4-person room starting with the
letter “O”, and a 2-person room starting with “A.”

I’d gotten used to getting directions from people in relation to some of the
bigger office landmarks—left of the Café; on the reception side, towards *Tupac*
(the West wing of the office)—and had been thinking about trying to better
navigate the office. I took the natural language directions that were
comfortable and common-sense to me, and plugged them into a site where you could
search for office rooms by name.

The result was Wayfinder, a web app for finding directions to office rooms in
the Dropbox SF office. Wayfinder has solidified itself as the go-to place for
quick, easy-to-understand directions for Dropboxers new and old to get around
the San Francisco office, and has become one of the tools introduced to new
employees during onboarding.

As well as the web app, I spent a few weeks learning Swift for iOS and creating
a native app. I also worked with an Android engineer in the office to create a
native Android app.
