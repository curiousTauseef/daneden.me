I can’t say with any degree of certainty that the hardships I’ve faced and the emotions they’ve prompted constitute depression. I can say for sure, however, that diagnosed depression has affected more than a few of my closest friends and family.

More people than I’d consider a fair amount have been deeply, lastingly affected by depression. It’s rarely clear exactly when they cross the threshold from just being regularly down-in-the-dumps to experiencing the constant, gnawing numbness that depression so often invokes, but when that ditinction is made, it’s usually far too late to act fast and recover easily.

I’m being purposefully vague to protect the identities of the people I love, but that doesn’t mean I can’t share their stories. They have many commonalities. As I mentioned, I can’t say for sure whether my observations of diagnosed depression can match at all the actual experiences of those that have suffered from it, but I have gone through trauma with similar reactions, and I’ve known many people close to me who have recounted their experiences.

For argument’s sake, I’m going to combine the observed characteristics, daily routines, and thought processes of depressed individuals into one unfortunate character. Her name is Sally, and she has depression.

* * *

Sally finds even the most plain and simple tasks unimaginably daunting and physically impossible. Something as simple as getting dressed on a given day is a monumental struggle for her, and on her best days, her achievements are considered small and are quickly forgotten.

Sally’s mood is quick to change. She may spend an entire day laughing and joking, but it only takes a brief moment—a fleeting thought, a passing comment, or even just an idle second—for the dark, numbing fog of depression to take hold again.

That’s one word I hear a lot in conversation about depression—fog. Stifling, thick, impenetrable fog. No matter how far you walk, or how bright your torch, or how loud you scream, there is nothing but thick, hard, choking fog. A paradoxical vast emptiness and intense confinement.

Sally doesn’t know what time it is. She doesn’t care. The mere thought of time passing bears too much weight. She knows she has things clamouring for her attention, but they have to wait. She has to be somewhere else—anywhere else—as long as it isn’t in the present. She has to be nowhere.

She is unintentionally cold and distant, and at times even cruel to the ones she holds dearest. A part of her is so irreparably lonesome that hostility is the only known defense against those now-too-familiar feelings of dread.

Sally sees no future, and what memories she has of the past are often loaded with regret. When a future is on the horizon, it’s often even more bleak and unfulfilling than the present, prompting desperation for escape—even suicide.

Recognising the behaviours and feelings of someone with depression can be extremely difficult. For most of my young life, depression was just another word for *very, very sad.* The truth is, it runs much deeper than mere sadness. Depression is a disabling, life-altering illness, that many people suffer from for the majority of their lives. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t help, or that you can’t be helped.
